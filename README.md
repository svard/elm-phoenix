# elm-phoenix
Native Phoenix channels in Elm

An implementation of [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org) channels in Elm inspired by mgold's [elm-socketio](https://github.com/mgold/elm-socketio).

The Chat example requires a Phoenix server setup as described in the [Channels guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/channels).

Currently this package have not been published as an elm package so in order to play with it this repo must be cloned inte your elm projects "elm-stuff" directory.
